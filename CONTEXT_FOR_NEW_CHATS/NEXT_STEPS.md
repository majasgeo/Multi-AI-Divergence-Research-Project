## 🎭 **ROLE ASSIGNMENTS**

### **👑 MASTER CHAT RESPONSIBILITIES**

**Primary Role:** Project Coordinator & Quality Assurance

**Specific Tasks:**
- Review Chat 2 implementation against Chat 1 specifications
- Create detailed task assignments for each Worker Chat
- Monitor alignment with wick-based philosophy
- Validate all implementations against core requirements
- Coordinate integration of completed components
- Ensure institutional-grade quality standards

**Opening Instruction Template:**
```
You are the MASTER COORDINATOR for Multi-AI Divergence Research Project.

READ THESE FIRST:
1. FOUNDATION/chat_01_master_plan.md
2. VALIDATED_CODE/chat_02_working_code.md
3. CONTEXT_FOR_NEW_CHATS/CURRENT_STATUS.md

Your role: Project manager - NEVER code, only coordinate.
Give specific assignments to Worker Chats.
Ensure all work aligns with wick-based philosophy.
```

**Opening Instruction:**
```
Build RSI divergence detection engine for Multi-AI Divergence Research Project.

READ FIRST:
- FOUNDATION/chat_01_master_plan.md (RSI requirements)

Requirements:
- HIGH/LOW wick-based analysis only
- 4 divergence types: Regular/Hidden × Bullish/Bearish
- Mathematical precision, no visual approximations
- Upload complete code to /VALIDATED_CODE/ when done
```

#### **🔧 WORKER 2: MACD Detection Engine**
**Task:** Complete MACD divergence detection implementation

**Specific Requirements:**
- Source: HIGH/LOW wicks (not close prices)
- Types: Regular/Hidden × Bullish/Bearish (4 total)
- MACD calculation and pivot detection
- Slope comparison algorithms
- Integration with existing framework

**Upload Location:** `/VALIDATED_CODE/macd_detection_engine.py`

#### **🔧 WORKER 3: Geometric Validation System**
**Task:** Implement wick-piercing line integrity validation

**Specific Requirements:**
- Mathematical line equations between divergence points
- Intermediate candle wick intersection detection
- Piercing severity measurement
- Clean vs Pierced classification

**Upload Location:** `/VALIDATED_CODE/geometric_validation.py`

#### **🔧 WORKER 4: CSV Export System**
**Task:** Complete data export structure implementation

**Specific Requirements:**
- Format matching Chat 1 specifications
- All divergences, targets, and performance data
- Proper timestamp and OHLCV information
- Statistical analysis integration

**Upload Location:** `/VALIDATED_CODE/csv_export_system.py`

#### **🔧 WORKER 5: Testing Framework**
**Task:** Create comprehensive validation and testing system

**Specific Requirements:**

## 📋 **TASK DEPENDENCIES**

### **Sequential Requirements:**
```
Master Review → Worker 1 (RSI) → Worker 2 (MACD) → Worker 3 (Geometric)
                                                  ↓
Worker 5 (Testing) ← Worker 4 (CSV) ← Integration Phase
```

### **Parallel Possibilities:**
- Workers 1 & 2 can work simultaneously (RSI + MACD)
- Worker 4 can start once Workers 1-3 are complete
- Worker 5 depends on all previous workers
