## üéØ TARGET CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### **Complete Target System (48 targets per divergence):**

**4 Scenarios √ó 12 Targets each:**

1. **First Candle + Current Method** (12 targets)
2. **First Candle + Alternative Method** (12 targets)  
3. **Last Candle + Current Method** (12 targets)
4. **Last Candle + Alternative Method** (12 targets)

**Each scenario includes:**
- 6 Bollinger Band targets: SMA20 (Upper, Middle, Lower) + SMA58 (Upper, Middle, Lower)
- 6 Reverse Fibonacci targets: -1 projections from each Bollinger target

### **Reverse Fibonacci Logic:**

**BULLISH DIVERGENCES (Current Method):**
```
1 = Bollinger Target (e.g., Upper Band)
0 = LOW WICK of candle (lowest point)
-1 = 0 - 2√ó(1-0) = Projection BELOW low wick
```

**BEARISH DIVERGENCES (Current Method):**
```
1 = Bollinger Target (e.g., Lower Band)  
0 = HIGH WICK of candle (highest point)
-1 = 0 + 2√ó(1-0) = Projection ABOVE high wick
```

**Alternative Method:** Uses opposite wick (HIGH for bullish, LOW for bearish)
