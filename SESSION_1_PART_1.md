## 🧠 RESEARCH PROCESS (Not Summaries)

### PHASE 1: Fibonacci Discovery (Chat 1)
- Had working system (96.11% claimed)
- Formula: `C = B + (A→B × fib_level)`
- Ratios: 0.618, 2.618, 0.786, 0.236
- Perfect match: $109,987.2 (0.03 USD error!)

### PHASE 2: Bollinger Pivot (Chat 2)
- Started thinking: Bollinger Bands
- Tested 34 parameters → **ALL FAILED**
- Discovery: **Fibonacci Projections**
- 54 patterns, 35.2% hit rate (vs 16% random)

### PHASE 3: Reality Check (Chat 3)  
- Algorithm predicted $16,130
- Actual: $19,526 (21% error)
- Data source confusion
- Golden Ratio + WMA(10) found

### PHASE 4: Divergence Deep Dive (CHAT 712KB)

**Bodies vs Wicks:**
```
Question: "Body-based (traditional) or Wick-based?"
Research: Professionals use wicks
Decision: WICKS (liquidity zones, true sentiment)
```

**Wick Piercing Rule:**
```
"If intermediate wick cuts through divergence line → invalidates"
Validation: NO institutional standard exists
Result: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
```

**Reverse Fibonacci:**
```
BULLISH: -1 = low_wick - 2×(BB_target - low_wick)
BEARISH: -1 = high_wick + 2×(BB_target - high_wick)
```

**Big Theory:**
```
"Markets rise on REVERSE bearish (not bullish divergences)"
Why: Liquidation cascades > natural buying
```

**Testing Results:**
- 130 candles, 17 divergences
- WICK wins 7/8 scenarios
- Performance: +10.7% to +24.0%
- Long-term: 3-6+ years validated

### PHASE 5: π Paradox (Wave Pulse)
```
Copilot: 182/182 = 100% π matches
Original: 0/32 = 0% π matches

Resolution: Different datasets
- Original: Real trades (no π)
- INDEX: Processed data (artificial π)

Conclusion: π was FALSE
New target: 60-75% win rate (realistic)
```

### PHASE 6: GEO Theory
**3-Part System:**
1. Divergences = Engine (compressed > extended)
2. Bollinger = Targets (SMA20/58 intersections)
3. Reverse Fib = Catalyst (-1 collection before execution)

**The Mystery (GAP 2):**
"Why 3m → 3D timeframe jumps?" ← UNSOLVED

**Backtest:** 83.3% win rate (42 signals, 4H)

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHTS

**Evolution:**
Fibonacci → BB (failed) → Fibonacci → Wicks → Reverse → Integration → π false

**What Works:**
- Wick-based (7/8 wins)
- Reverse Fib (55-96% success)
- Multi-theory (80%+ backtests)

**What's Uncertain:**
- Small samples
- GAP 2 unsolved
- Accuracy claims (96% → 60-75%)

**User's Rigor:**
"No opinion until 15m minimum" ← Scientific approach
