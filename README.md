# 🎯 ULTIMATE DIVERGENCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM
## Complete Project Roadmap & Specifications

---

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### 🎯 **Core Mission**
Create a **professional-grade divergence analysis system** for **high-leverage trading** with **institutional-level precision** using **advanced geometric validation** and **reverse Fibonacci projections**.

### 🏆 **Key Philosophy**
- **Quality over quantity** - Fewer but cleaner signals
- **Geometric precision** - No compromises on line integrity  
- **Wick-based analysis** - Real market extremes, not arbitrary closes
- **Reverse scenario focus** - Where the real money is made
- **Professional validation** - Institutional-grade filtering

## 🧠 USER'S TRADING PHILOSOPHY & REQUIREMENTS

### 💭 **Core Beliefs**
1. **"Markets rise on reverse/overplayed reverse bearish, not bullish divergences"**
2. **"Wick piercing invalidates divergences"** - If intermediate wick breaks the divergence line, signal quality degrades
3. **"Wicks matter more than bodies"** - Real extremes show true market sentiment
4. **"High leverage requires precision"** - Cannot afford retail-level "maybe" signals
5. **"Bollinger Bands need optimization"** - Current SMA20/58 are observational, not optimal
6. **"EVERYTHING moves from divergences"** - Divergences can set targets 5 years into the future
7. **"Pattern decryption is key"** - Understanding how each wave and micro-wave plays out based on divergence targets

### 🎯 **Target Use Case**
- **Prove that EVERYTHING moves from divergences** - Divergences can predict targets years ahead
- **Discover the logic behind target formation** - Find optimal entry patterns
- **Top-down approach**: Start from large timeframes (1M) to validate theory, then scale down to minute-level precision
- **Ultimate goal**: Achieve absolute optimal entries through complete pattern decryption
- **High leverage entries** (significant position sizing)
- **Monthly/Weekly timeframes** initially (1M, 4W, 1W, 7D) expanding to minute-level
- **XBTUSD focus** for initial testing
- **Institutional-quality signals** only

### 📊 **Required Analysis Types**
1. **RSI Divergences** (4 types: Regular/Hidden × Bullish/Bearish)
2. **MACD Divergences** (4 types: Regular/Hidden × Bullish/Bearish)
3. **Line integrity validation** (wick piercing detection)
4. **Bollinger Band projections** (SMA20 & SMA58 initially)
5. **Reverse Fibonacci calculations** (12 targets per divergence)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### 📈 **Divergence Detection Logic**
- **Source**: HIGH/LOW (wicks) - NOT close prices
- **Validation**: Geometric line integrity check
- **Classification**: Clean vs Pierced divergences
- **Timeframes**: 1M, 4W, 1W, 7D (expandable)

### 🎯 **Target Calculation System**
For each divergence, calculate **24 target levels**:

#### **First Candle Targets (12):**
- **6 Bollinger targets**: SMA20 (upper, middle, lower) + SMA58 (upper, middle, lower)
- **6 Reverse Fibonacci**: -1 projections from each Bollinger target

#### **Last Candle Targets (12):**
- **6 Bollinger targets**: SMA20 (upper, middle, lower) + SMA58 (upper, middle, lower)  
- **6 Reverse Fibonacci**: -1 projections from each Bollinger target

### 🧮 **Reverse Fibonacci Logic**
```
BULLISH DIVERGENCE (expect up, but calculate down scenarios):
- 1 = BB Target (e.g., Upper Band)
- 0 = LOW WICK of candle
- -1 = 0 - 2*(1-0) = Projection BELOW low wick

BEARISH DIVERGENCE (expect down, but calculate up scenarios):
- 1 = BB Target (e.g., Lower Band)  
- 0 = HIGH WICK of candle
- -1 = 0 + 2*(1-0) = Projection ABOVE high wick
```

### 📊 **Data Export Structure**
```csv
